# song-classifier
AI model to detect song characteristics

Pre-requisites:
• NodeJS v.6.2.0+
• NPM
• Apply for a spotify developer account

Steps to run: In console navigate to the root directory of the project
1) Run npm install
2) After that is completed run npm test (execution time can last upwards of a few minutes)
3) Output will be logged in console

Note: Using this repo requires a valid Spotify developer account. For grading purposes I will keep my account credentials active until the end of the semester. Spotify rate limits api calls, when running npm test you may encounter errors downloading song data. According to Spotify terms of service, a user cannot upload data obtained from the API which is why there is no data directory included in this repo.

The code executed during npm test is included inside ./test/sanity.js.
